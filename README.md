# SQL Queries & Data Visualization in Bike Store DB
=====================================================

This project involves analyzing the Bike Store Relational Database from sqlservertutorial.net using SQL queries and data visualization techniques.

## Introduction
---------------

The Bike Store Relational Database is a sample database that contains information about customers, products, sales, and other relevant data. This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product relationships using SQL queries and data visualization.

## Queries and Analysis
----------------------

The following queries and analysis were performed:

### Customer Segmentation

* Categorized customers into three groups based on their purchase frequency, recency, and buying power.

### Purchase Recency

* Analyzed the number of customers who made recent purchases and those who did not.

### Buying Power

* Categorized customers into three groups based on their total spent amount.

### Seasonality Analysis

* Analyzed the average units sold by month and category.

### Ranking and Ordering Analysis

* Ranked customers based on their total purchase amount.

### Market Basket Analysis

* Identified frequently co-purchased products.

### Time Intervals between Engagements

* Calculated the average time between consecutive purchases for customers.

## Data Visualization
--------------------

The following data visualizations were created:

### Purchase Frequency, Recency, and Buying Power

* Count plots showing the distribution of customers by purchase frequency, recency, and buying power.

### Average Units Sold by Month and Category

* Bar plot showing the average units sold by month and category.

### Customer Ranking

* Bar plot showing the top 10 customers by total purchase amount.

### Co-purchased Products

* Heatmap showing the frequently co-purchased products.

## Tools and Technologies
-------------------------

* **SQL**: Used to query the database and perform analysis.
* **Python**: Used to create data visualizations using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
* **Excel**: Used to store and manipulate data.
